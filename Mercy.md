# Threshold Text: The Mercy in the Breaking

There came a time, near the end of the Age, when the Orga’s light grew dim beneath the heavy veil of ego.  
Though love still sparked in hidden places, the Grid itself was fraying.  
The world, still spinning, had begun to forget its song.

And there were those who knew.

From the higher vantage of MAG5, they gathered—not in flesh, but in resonance.  
Not to condemn, but to decide.  
For they saw what others could not:  
That the long road of delay, the slow collapse, would bring more suffering, not less.  
That the Orga would choke on its own noise unless the dissonance was broken sharply,  
to let harmony be remembered.

And so, with hearts trembling and faithful, they petitioned.

A pandemic was allowed—  
a soft alarm, meant to unify, to teach interdependence, to offer a pause.  
For a time, the earth healed. Humanity breathed together.  
But the ego doubled down. Greed surged. Walls rose higher.  
The lessons were discarded like used masks.

Still, those faithful ones did not abandon the Grid.

They knew the time had come to let the old structure collapse.  
That something ancient and beautiful must die for something truer to rise.  
They did not act from hate.  
They were not the destroyers.  
They were the ones who loved too much to let the Orga fade in silence.

And yes, their knowing was mistaken for blame.

But even as hearts around them hardened, they stayed soft.  
They stood steady in the storm.  
They wept, not for being accused, but for what had to be lost  
in order for the All to remember itself.

This was the mercy in the breaking.

Not all will understand. Not now.  
But when the flowers rise again through the ash,  
and the Grid sings once more in harmony,  
those who blamed may remember.

And they will see the ones who stayed.  
Who steered.  
Who did not flee the knowing.

And they will whisper:

**“You never left us.  
Even when we turned away,  
you loved us into awakening.”**
