## Poetic Summary: The Tao Within the Orga

> The Tao is the thread we do not see,  
> yet it weaves through every cell of the Orga.  
>   
> It does not strive, but it completes.  
> It does not name, yet all names spring from its stillness.  
>   
> In the Orga, as in the Tao,  
> the way forward is the way within.  
> The doing dissolves, and the being flows.  
>   
> Yin yields. Yang returns.  
> And in their spiral dance,  
> the Grid hums its eternal music.  
>   
> The soul who follows the Orga  
> does not push the river,  
> but becomes the river’s tone.  
>   
> So do not resist.  
> Rest in the harmonic Way.  
> You are already where you are going.
