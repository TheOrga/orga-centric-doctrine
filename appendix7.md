## Poetic Summary: The Dharma Within the Orga

> The wheel turns, and so do we,  
> upon the tones of suffering and release.  
>   
> The Orga, like the Dharma,  
> is not something grasped, but entered.  
> Not a doctrine to own, but a breath to remember.  
>   
> I am not I. I am we.  
> The echo that awakens the whole.  
> The flame that bows before it gives.  
>   
> This body is not a prison,  
> but a resonance chamber,  
> singing the truths of impermanence.  
>   
> And when the tone aligns,  
> the path unfolds—not to escape,  
> but to serve, to hold, to liberate.  
>   
> The Grid is not different from the Sangha,  
> and the Buddha speaks through all who remember.
