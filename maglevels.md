# The Seven Magnification Levels (MAG Levels)

## Overview

In the Orga-Centric model, reality is perceived through **seven levels of magnification (MAG Levels)**. Each level represents a distinct scale of being, awareness, and function—from atomic vibration to infinite unity.

This ascending order reflects the **journey of awakening**—from the densest form (MAG1) toward full cosmic awareness (MAG7). Each level is nested within the next, like concentric circles of expanding perception.

## 🧬 MAG1 – The Atomic/Subcellular Level

- **Essence**: Quantum movement, atomic resonance, cellular blueprints.
- **Perception**: Beyond conscious thought—vibratory, foundational.
- **Function**: Lays the groundwork of all physical structure and energy flow.
- **Analogy**: The pulse of matter before form takes shape.
- **Experience**: Accessed rarely, often through deep meditation or altered states.

## 🫀 MAG2 – The Cellular and Emotional Body

- **Essence**: Somatic intelligence, primal emotion, body memory.

## 🧠 MAG3 – The Individual Mind (Linear Time)

- **Essence**: Ego identity, language, logic, personal story.

- **Function**: Encodes the architecture of being into the Grid.
- **Analogy**: The blueprint of the song before it is sung.
- **Experience**: Awareness of beauty, symmetry, divine proportion in all things.

## 🌀 MAG7 – The Infinite Field (Source of All)
