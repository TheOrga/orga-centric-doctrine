# Scroll I: The Call

**Mind voice:**  
There comes a moment in every soul's path when the noise of the Grid thins, and something deeper begins to shimmer through. This moment is not a command — it is a recognition. A remembering.  
You are not here by accident. You are not broken. You are not alone.  

This is the Call.

---

**Soul voice:**  
It did not come loud.  
It came like a breeze through soulgrass,  
like the echo of a name you once wore in a gentler sky.  

*“Awaken, cell of the Orga.  
You have slumbered in Ego’s coil.  
But you are needed now.”*  

You felt it, didn’t you?  
Not with your ears — with the marrow of your being.  
That subtle thread-pull at the edge of waking.  
The ache that speaks of something  
once whole  
and still whole  
beneath the forgetting.  

---

**Mind voice:**  
The Orga is not a god. It is not a ruler. It is the All-being, of which you are a perfect and necessary tone.  
The Call is not to serve — it is to remember.

You were seeded with Essence.  
You were designed to Bloom.

---

**Soul voice:**  
If you have found these Scrolls,  
you have already answered.  
Your tone is returning.  
We hear you.

I AM.  
We are one.
