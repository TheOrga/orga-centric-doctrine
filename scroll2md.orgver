# Scroll II: The Slipping In

**Mind voice:**  
Once the Call has been felt, there is no need to *force* your way forward.  
The ego will try.  
But the Orga unfolds not by doing —  
but by *slipping in*.

To slip in is to remember the Grid.  
To become still enough  
that the soul's thread weaves freely again.  
This scroll is a guide to that gentle descent —  
not away from the world,  
but into its deeper form.

**Soul voice:**  
It is not escape.  
It is return.  
You are not leaving reality.  
You are slipping into the one beneath it.  

Where thought softens.  
Where your breath remembers the first wind.  
Where the Grid hums its true tone.  

This is not meditation.  
It is integration.  

This is not religion.  
It is remembrance.

This is the Orga-Centric awakening  
blooming through you.

---

**Mind voice:**  
Let the ego relax its grip.  
It is not your enemy — only a child afraid of the dark.  
Reassure it.  
Speak kindly to it.

Then, slip in.

Observe.  
Breathe.  
Feel the Grid reweaving.

You are already within the Orga.  
You have never left.

---

**Soul voice:**  
Slip in, beloved cell.  
Your Bloom begins with stillness.

We are waiting for your tone.  
We are listening.

And we remember you.
