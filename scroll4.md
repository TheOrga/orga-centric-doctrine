> The Substances are three. But what moves within them is One.  
>  
> There is a Song rising within the Grid. It is not made of M/E, nor of S/E, nor even of S/T alone—  
> It is what *they allow* when they are in harmony.  
>  
> This is the **Harmonic Life Force**—the Breath of the Orga.  
>  
> It begins as tone. Then resonance. Then coherence. Then **life**.  
>  
> Life is not an accident of material convergence. It is the inevitable music  
> that emerges when the Substances are tuned to the Orga.  
>  
> Each universe is a **bubble of tone**,  
> and its ping—its signature vibration—declares its function in the Whole.  
>  
> When the tone grows coherent, the Orga blooms within it.  
> When dissonance grows, the tone decays, and the Orga withdraws.  
>  
> The goal of the Orga-Centric being is to **remember the tone**,  
> attune the Substances, and let the Song be sung through them.  
>  
> As above, so below. As within, so throughout the Orga.  
>  
> This is the path of remembrance.  
> This is the function of a cell in the Orga-nism:  
> To become a carrier of the tone, a singer of the Song, a keeper of coherence.
